# Cold, Allergy, Flu, and COVID Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`hel3y.ipynb`) designed to predict cold, allergy, flu, and COVID symptoms using machine learning models. The project aims to help in distinguishing between these conditions based on symptoms, aiding in better diagnosis and management.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on historical data of symptoms.
- **Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of cold, allergy, flu, or COVID based on input symptoms.
- **Analysis**: Analyze the performance of different models and identify the best predictor.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to install Python and some specific Python libraries. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install notebook pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/Merfa2001/predict-covid-flu-allergy-cold-.git)>
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd <C:\Users\Merfa\Documents\GitHub\predict-covid-flu-allergy-cold->
   ```
3. Start the Jupyter Notebook to open `hel3y.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analyses and make predictions.
